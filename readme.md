# Glassmorphism-1

> There's a new UI trend and it looks just like glass :)

A webpage built with HTML, SASS & GSAP that features the 'Glassmorphism' UI design trend.

## Packages/Dependencies

In this project, I used the GreenSocks animation library to make some of the smooth animations you'll see on the page but you dont have to install it via `npm`.
I installed it via `CDN` and it should work just fine on your machine if you are connected to the internet.

## Quick Start/Installation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Clone the repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/airykka/Glassmorphism-1.git
  ```
* Then enter the folder ```Glassmorphism-1```

    ```shell
  cd Glassmorphism-1
  ```

* Then open the ```index.html``` file in your web browser on your local machine.

* ...and that's it! You will now be able to see the webpage featuring the UI glass effect.
